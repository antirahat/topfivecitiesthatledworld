                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">Paris has been a center of intellectual and artistic movements for centuries. In the Middle Ages, it was the largest city in Europe and the birthplace of Gothic architecture, with landmarks like Notre-Dame Cathedral exemplifying this style. The University of Paris, established in the 12th century, became a leading center of learning. Throughout the Enlightenment, Parisian salons fostered philosophical debates that shaped modern Western thought. The city's enduring commitment to arts and education solidifies its status as a global cultural capital.</p>
